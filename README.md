Hey ðŸ‘‹! I'm Ringo Hoffman, also known as zekro, and I'm a passionate german full stack developer in the age of `{currentYear - 1998}`.

I love playing with web technologies, creating web applications and building automatic pipelines to deploy them. I'm a huge lover of docker and linux. Mostly, I'm working with C# (.NET Core/Framework), Go and TypeScript, but I'm also verry experienced using stuff like Python, Java, Elixir, C++, Lua or Dart.

Here you can see a usage statistic over all my public and private github repositories.
